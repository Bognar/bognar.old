This post is based on my experience working on different accounts and projects. For me, it requires a lot of traveling so backpacks need to be as light as possible. We have limited space in our backpack but still, some small tools can be handy to have when you go to locations or clients where you will need to do some testing or checking.

Sometimes you will need to check if the network cable has a connection, check the IP address, or try to see other devices in your local network. Sure, having a laptop and plugging is not so hard but still, why not have some small tool in my pocket? If you are like me, like to find cheap and practical tools, ethernet to USB-C would be a great addition to your daily tasks.

In the image up we can see three different things:
1. Device is connected to the mobile phone, green and red light is on indicating that it's connected to the phone(green) and that there is nothing connected on RJ45 port, something is connected but the port is not alive, or network cable is faulty.
2. Device is connected to both the mobile phone and ethernet cable that is alive.
3. On the top left side, we see <---> which indicates that there is internet access, and we can browse the internet or use apps like the Net Analyzer to investigate local networks.

If someone has similar experience, write me an email or share it in comments.
