Hi, and thanks for reading this!

My name is Josip Bognar. I was born in a small village called Laslovo(Eastern part of Croatia). My life journey was bumpy so I have lived also in Szigetvár (Hungary) and from 2019 in Dublin(Ireland).

I am a proactive person and from my young age, I've tried to do a lot of things like Ornithology, Origami, Kirigami, sales business, and much more. My big passion was and still is technology, I invest a lot of time to find out how things work, to make something easier on my job, or find a way to automate some process/ routine jobs.

There are two major sides of me in technology, one is being a full-stack developer dealing with HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Angular, Ionic, Firebase, NodeJS, NPM, GEM, Git Jekyll, MySQL, PostgreSQL, restful API development, mobile app development with a slight touch of Java, C++, Android Studio, Qbasic. Another side is being Service Desk Engineer, App/Technical support where I am exposed to a lot of different technologies and operating systems such as Windows Server, MacOS, iOS, Azure, AWS, Active Directory, GPO’s, SCCM, PXE servers, PowerShell scripting, Bash scripting, Linux, and Linux servers, VM’s, Networking, Laptop, and PC building, etc..

I am a big fan of open source so that's why I switched from Windows to Linux. This website is hosted for free on Github and also built with a free tool called Jekyll this is how I show my commitment to open source and I tend to speak about different flavors of Linux with people who still use Windows. My opinion is that Linux should be used on desktop PC more often but for people outside the technology branch, it can be scary or confusing just because of the dominance of the Windows operating system.

My current job is to work on projects and clients. Sometimes projects are only 3-4 days like deploying 100 laptops or PC’s and sometimes months, where we set Windows image with task sequences, get a Hash ID for autopilot, install Windows on thousands of laptops, and package apps to SCCM to deploy them to those devices, set GPO’s on users and devices, create collections and much more. In my work, I often use PowerShell and scripts such as PowerShell Deployment ToolKit and Windows AutoPilotInfo.

My free time is usually filled with reading tutorials, doing certifications, reading books, comics, playing games, and playing the ukulele.

I am always looking for a new opportunity where I can grow more so feel free to ping me regarding some new job or a project.
