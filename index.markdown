<span class="feathertext">Welcome to my website!<br> <br>
You can find here more about me. If you want to connect or check some of my blog posts about what I found useful, how to do things, and also what is the inspiration for me these days. A lot of things I will save to repositories on GitHub so feel free to browse them.
